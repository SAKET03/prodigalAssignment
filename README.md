# ðŸ“ž Prodigal AI Assignment - Call Analysis Suite

A comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing debt collection conversations. This project includes two main components:

1. **Debt Collection Conversation Analyzer** (Q1-2): Detects profanity and privacy compliance violations
2. **Interactive Call Analysis Dashboard** (Q3): Analyzes overtalk and silence metrics with visual timelines


```
IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to memory restriction in streamlit deploy I was not able to deploy the applications.
